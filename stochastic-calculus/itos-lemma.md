To differentiate $$f(t,X_t)$$,


$$
df(t,X_t)= f_t(t,X_t)dt + f_x(t,X_t)dX_t + \frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(t,X_t)dX_tdX_t.
$$


Two-dimensional $$f(t,X_t, Y_y)$$,


$$
df= f_tdt + f_xdX_t + f_ydY_t + \frac{1}{2}f_{xx}dX_tdX_t + \frac{1}{2}f_{yy}dX_tdX_t + f_{xy}dX_tdY_t.
$$
Product Rule,


$$
dX_tY_t = X_tdY_t + Y_tdX_t + dX_tdY_t.
$$
