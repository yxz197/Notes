### Cox-Ingersoll-Ross IR Model

Consider the interest rate $$R(t)$$ satisfying


$$
  dR(t) = (\alpha-\beta R(t))dt +  \sigma \sqrt{R(t)}dW(t).
$$


Like Vasicek model, it is mean-reverting; unlike Vasicek model, it does not have a closed-form solution. However, we can derive $$E[R(t)]$$ and $$\text{Var}[R(t)]$$ for each fixed $$t$$ .
