If you donâ€™t declare them yourself, compilers will declare their own versions of **a copy constructor**, **a copy assignment operator**, and **a destructor**. Furthermore, if you declare no constructors at all, compilers will also declare **a default constructor** for you. All these functions will be both _public_ and _inline._
